        <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>

        <p>
            Delicious home-made chicken burger, not dry or boring like your typical
            chicken burger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chicken burgers are notoriously dry, but not anymore! 
            Adding minced roasted mushrooms to ground chicken not only adds extra 
            moisture, it gives a deep umami flavor that even beef lovers will 
            drool over. A little more time-intensive than a regular burger, 
            this version is oozing with flavor and well worth the extra effort–crunchy, 
            tangy, sweet, savory and juicy, all in one burger. The jalapeños aren't 
            spicy because they are seeded, but if you want an extra kick, leave the 
            seeds in. Save time by making the sauce, slaw and patties ahead of time.
